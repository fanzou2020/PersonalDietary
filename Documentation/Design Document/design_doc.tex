\chapter{Introduction}
The project undertaken in this COMP 5541 course involves creating an application that keeps track of dietary records for the user. This diet app has been designed to use the border pane layout for the main window. \\ \\ 
This design document will provide details for the type of software architecture used to develop the software and explain the design for the user interface. The architectural component illustrates the abstraction of the software classes involved and how they relate to each other to maniuplate and process data that the user interacts with. The interface design section will assess the process for the states the user goes through to interact with the personal dietary application.
\section{Purpose}
This document will serve as an illustration for the architectural design choices as well as an explanation for the properties of the user interface implemented for the Personal Dietary Application software. This software project is being completed for the COMP 5541 graduate diploma course at Concordia University. There will be diagrams to chowcase the type of the architecture used and a class diagram. Screenshots are used to provide a valuable perspective on the user interface. These graphical aids are described in further detail to demonstrate the functionality of the interface.
\section{Scope}
In order to provide proper design documentation for the Personal Dietary Application this document will be properly formatted and included all necessary information. The team responsible for surveying this document and creating the software will be able to use the robust explanation of the architectural model presented in this document to carry out the necessary work. The visual graphics demonstrating the user interface design choices will serve as a guide for the team to orchestrate the proper performance of the software.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
	Term & Definition \\
\hline
	Model View & Software architecture that renders funcionality between three components. \\

\section{Overview}
The rest of the document is composed of two main sections. First, there is a section dedication to Architectural Design. Lastly, the largest section, consists of Software Interface Design. In the portion concerning the software architecture the three smaller sections are related to the reasoning for choosing the architecture, a diagram illustrating how the architecture behaves abstractly, and the final section details how software files will operate together on the computer. \\
The interface section will provide documentation regarding the system, modules, and dynamic interfaces for the software project.
