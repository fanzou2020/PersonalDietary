    \chapter{Introduction}
    This master testing document describes the strategies and tools we (Team 4) used to test the Personal Dietary Manager application. This testing document serves as the deliverable document for iteration 3 of the class project in COMP 5541 at Concordia Univeristy. Iteration 3 is the final iteration of of Personal Dietary Manager, and implements database functionality using MySQL. \\ \\
    Associated with this test plan are documents delivered in iteration 1 and iteration 2 of this project. These are, respectively, the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and Design Documents (DD). This test plan will refer to these other documents for the purpose of traceability.

    \section{Purpose}
    The purpose of this test plan is to verify the quality and correctness of the Personal Dietary Manager application. Correctness is the state in which the application satisfies the SRS and delivers a product that can accurately track a dietary regimen. Quality is the state in which the application delivers a user-friendly experience that is free of bugs, runs fast, and runs smoothly. \\\\
    As no software project is perfect, any outstanding bugs and issues will also be discussed.

    \section{Scope}
    The scope of this test document are the tools are strategies that are used for testing. These are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unit testing
        \item Integration and Module Testing
        \item Function Testing
        \item User Interface Testing
    \end{itemize}
    Tests that are outside of the scope of this document are load, configuration and installation, business analysis, network security, and stress testing.
