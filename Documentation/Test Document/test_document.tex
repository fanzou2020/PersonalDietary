    \chapter{Introduction}
    This master testing document describes the strategies and tools we (Team 4) used to test the Personal Dietary Manager application. This testing document serves as the deliverable document for iteration 3 of the class project in COMP 5541 at Concordia Univeristy. Iteration 3 is the final iteration of of Personal Dietary Manager, and implements database functionality using MySQL. \\ \\
    Associated with this test plan are documents delivered in iteration 1 and iteration 2 of this project. These are, respectively, the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) and Design Documents (DD). This test plan will refer to these other documents for the purpose of traceability.

    \section{Purpose}
    The purpose of this test plan is to verify the quality and correctness of the Personal Dietary Manager application. Correctness is the state in which the application satisfies the SRS and delivers a product that can accurately track a dietary regimen. Quality is the state in which the application delivers a user-friendly experience that is free of bugs, runs fast, and runs smoothly. \\\\
    As no software project is perfect, any outstanding bugs and issues will also be discussed.

    \section{Scope}
    The scope of this test document are the tools are strategies that are used for testing. These are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unit testing
        \item Integration and Module Testing
        \item Function Testing
        \item User Interface Testing
    \end{itemize}
    Tests that are outside of the scope of this document are load, configuration and installation, business analysis, network security, and stress testing.

    \chapter{Evaluation Mission Test Motivation}
    
    The purpose of this test document is to ensure the personal dietary desktop application meets the design requirements mandated by the course objectives outlined in the project specification document and system requirements document. This document will be a tool to outline test cases and keep a quality assurance guideline for the software development team. Lastly, the 'team 4' group will deliver an exceptional piece of quality software.

    \section{Background}
The graduate diploma course COMP 5541 mandated a personal dietary application be developed as part of a group project for the semester. The third increment of this project involved implementing a database for use with the desktop application. A remote database server offered by Microsoft, Azure, is utilized. The Java programming language and GUI library JavaFX. A comprehensive testing environment has been created to make sure the software is completed without any major issues or bugs. 
\par
This test document outlines several testing methods and processes that were used to verify the software is without serious bugs. The previous document included, the design document, had the software architecture and design pattern specifications. The initial document, the requirements document, contained the class diagrams, use case diagrams, and the purpose and demands the software is intended to fulfill.

    \section{Evaluation Mission}
    The principal goals of this document are evaluated as the following:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Making sure that the design document quality is adhered to.
    \item Guaranteeing the software requirement document specifications are completed.
    \item That any major software bugs are not found in the application.
    \end{itemize}
    
    The test plan document will be used as a tool to make sure these missions are accomplished.

    \section{Test Motivators}
    The areas explored in this testing document are the following:
\\    
    Unit Testing: A set number of methods are tested to verify their inputs and outputs meet the specifications. White and black box testing methods are used.\\
    Integration and Module Testing: The classes and objects are tested together to see if behavior remains consistent. \\
    Function Testing: Makes sure that use cases objectives are accomplished.
    User Interface Testing: The GUI that the user interacts with is checked for malfunctions.
